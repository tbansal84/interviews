Communication protocol/ Type of API exposed
The HTTP/S protocol is the most popular way to implement synchronous communication between microservices. For this, RESTful APIs will be the type of API to be exposed to consuming applications using the HTTP as a transport layer. The REST architectural style relies on stateless communication, uniform interfaces, and standard methods.
